During my 2016 Summer internship, I had the opportunity to work with HTML/CSS and PHP when my company began hosting a local Medical Practice's multi-page website.This repo contains a few snippets of the code I worked with, reformatted, and wrote for the client.
My tasks included:
                    communicated with the client 
                    created my own JIRA tasks after client meetings
                    reorganized of the information and layout of the pages
                    eliminated redundancy
                    made content edits
                    used SourceTree and Git to record and communicate the changes I made with my team
                    used FileZilla to locally host and then transfer the files to the appropriate server
