During my 2016 Summer internship, I had the opportunity to work with HTML/CSS and PHP when my company delegated content edits for an existing website to me.This repo contains a few snippets of the code I worked with and reformatted.

My tasks and experience with this project included:
                    Creating my own JIRA tasks based on the changes the client had emailed
                    Eliminated redundancy
                    Made content edits
                    Fixed spelling errors
                    Used SourceTree and Git to record and communicate the changes I made with my team
                    Our company hosted this client's website on Rackspace
                    Used MAMP as a local server
                    Used FileZilla to transfer the files to the appropriate server
