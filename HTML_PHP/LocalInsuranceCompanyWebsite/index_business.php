By offering several levels of deductibles and coverages, as well as different payment plans, we can customize a policy that will work for you.</p>

	<h2>Independent Insurance Agents</h2>
	<p>Independent agents do not work for an insurance company; we work for you. We work on your side when you have a loss and follow through to see that you receive fair, prompt payment and service. We have the advantage of flexibility in finding you the best insurance company and coverage for your needs.</p>
	<p>Unlike an insurance agency that exclusively provides coverage from one source, our agency represents many different insurance companies, allowing us to shop for the coverage that best meets your needs and your budget. We also have an advantage over Internet insurance companies by providing local, personal service by real people who are eager to help you with all your insurance needs.</p>
