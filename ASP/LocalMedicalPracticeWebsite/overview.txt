During my 2016 Summer internship, I had the opportunity to work with HTML/CSS and the .NET Framework ASP when my company began hosting a local Medical Practice's multi-page website.This repo contains a few snippets of the code I worked with, reformatted, and wrote for the client.

My tasks and experience with this project included:
                    Communicating with the client 
                    Creating my own JIRA tasks after client meetings
                    Reorganization of the information and layout of the pages
                    Eliminated redundancy
                    Made content edits
                    Used SourceTree and Git to record and communicate the changes I made with my team
                    Used FileZilla to locally host and then transfer the files to the appropriate server
